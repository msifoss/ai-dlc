# Retrospective — v1.1.0 Olympus Meld

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Scope:** Framework v1.0.0 → v1.1.0

---

## What Went Well

1. **Parallel execution:** 7 background agents completed simultaneously, reducing wall-clock time from ~1 hour of sequential work to ~15 minutes of parallel execution.

2. **Plan-first approach:** The detailed plan file specified all 18 file changes before any code was written. This eliminated scope creep and ensured nothing was forgotten.

3. **Wave dependency ordering:** Root files (Wave 4) correctly waited for all content files (Waves 1-3) to complete. No rework required.

4. **Zero merge conflicts:** Non-overlapping file assignments across agents meant zero conflicts despite 7 agents editing simultaneously.

5. **Verification as a final step:** Cross-reference verification confirmed all 28+ links resolved correctly, all 18 glossary terms were present, and all audit rubrics aligned.

## What Could Improve

1. **Framework doesn't eat its own dog food:** The v1.1.0 meld didn't follow AI-DLC phases — no formal requirements, no user stories, no traceability matrix for the framework itself. This was identified by the dlc-audit self-assessment (D2: 3/10, D3: 3/10).

2. **No captain's log written during execution:** This retrospective was written after the dlc-audit identified the gap, not during the bolt. The insight capture would have been richer if written in real-time.

3. **XL bolt should have been split:** The v1.1.0 meld was an XL bolt (~1 hour, 16 files, 966 lines). AI-DLC recommends splitting XL bolts. In practice, the parallel wave structure mitigated this, but formal bolt discipline was not followed.

4. **No Five Questions cycle:** The plan was accepted without a Five Questions cycle to surface assumptions. The assumptions were correct (no issues found), but the process was skipped.

## Action Items

| Item | Action | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Create framework-level REQUIREMENTS.md | Complete |
| 2 | Create framework-level USER-STORIES.md | Complete |
| 3 | Create framework-level TRACEABILITY-MATRIX.md | Complete |
| 4 | Create SECURITY.md for the project | Complete |
| 5 | Write captain's logs going forward for all framework development | Ongoing |
| 6 | Run dlc-audit at every version release | Ongoing |

## Patterns Extracted

1. **Parallel agent pattern for multi-file documentation updates:** Assign non-overlapping files to parallel agents with explicit edit instructions. Verify cross-references as a final step.

2. **Wave dependency ordering:** Group files by dependency. Root/summary files go last. Content files can be parallelized if they don't cross-reference each other's new content.

3. **Plan-then-execute for framework changes:** Large framework updates benefit from a detailed plan file that specifies every file change before execution begins.
