# Captain's Log — v1.1.0 Olympus Meld

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Bolt ID:** Framework-v1.1.0
**Size:** XL (split into 4 parallel waves)
**Duration:** ~1 hour
**Author:** Framework maintainer + AI pair

## Context

The AI-DLC framework v1.0.0 established the seven-phase lifecycle, four pillars, three governance models, and 14 templates. The Olympus multi-agent orchestration system had developed several innovations independently that could enrich the framework without breaking its tool-agnostic nature.

## Decision

Meld 7 key Olympus innovations into AI-DLC v1.1.0:
1. Five Tenets of autonomous execution
2. IDEA → INTENT → UNIT → BOLT artifact hierarchy
3. Multi-agent specialization with smart model routing
4. The Ascent persistence loop
5. Trust-adaptive gates (levels 0-3)
6. Self-learning system with 30-day pattern decay
7. Summit pattern for AI-generated deployment artifacts

## Execution

### Wave Structure

The work was organized into 4 waves with dependency ordering:

| Wave | Files | Strategy |
|------|-------|----------|
| Wave 1 | 1 new file (AUTONOMOUS-EXECUTION-GUIDE.md) | Sequential — standalone, no dependencies |
| Wave 2 | 5 phase guides (Phase 1, 2, 3, 5, 6) | Parallel — 5 agents simultaneously |
| Wave 3 | 8 files (governance, pillars, reference, skill) | Parallel — merged with Wave 2 (7 agents total) |
| Wave 4 | 3 root files (README, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG) | Sequential — depends on Waves 1-3 |

### Key Decisions

1. **Tool-agnostic framing:** All Olympus-specific terminology was presented as "one implementation" of universal principles. The framework never requires Olympus — it merely references it as evidence.

2. **Parallel agent execution:** Waves 2 and 3 were combined into 7 parallel agents to minimize wall-clock time. Each agent had explicit, non-overlapping file assignments to prevent merge conflicts.

3. **Verification pass:** After all agents completed, a dedicated verification agent confirmed all cross-references resolve, all glossary terms exist, and all audit scoring rubrics align.

### Results

- **16 files changed** (1 created, 15 edited)
- **966 lines inserted**, 13 removed
- **All cross-references verified** — 28+ valid references to the new guide
- **18 new glossary terms** added
- **4 audit dimensions** updated (D3, D4, D8, D9)
- **Zero errors** during execution

## Evidence

- Commit: `4086cf2 feat: meld Olympus innovations into AI-DLC v1.1.0`
- All files pass markdown syntax check
- Cross-reference verification: all links resolve
- CHANGELOG updated with comprehensive v1.1.0 entry

## Insights

1. **Parallel agent pattern works well for documentation:** Non-overlapping file assignments eliminated merge conflicts. This pattern should be reused for future multi-file updates.

2. **Wave structure with dependency ordering prevents rework:** Root files (README, CLAUDE.md, CHANGELOG) correctly waited for content files to be finalized.

3. **Explicit agent instructions produce better results:** Each agent received detailed edit instructions with exact insertion points, reducing ambiguity.

4. **Verification as a separate step is essential:** The post-completion verification agent caught nothing (all was correct), but its existence provided confidence in the result.

## Traceability

- **Requirements:** FR-008 (autonomous execution), FR-009 (tool-agnostic)
- **Related ADR:** ADR-001 (seven-phase lifecycle)
- **CHANGELOG:** v1.1.0 entry documents all changes
